# Open Cascade Lessons ([Quaoar's Workshop](https://www.youtube.com/c/QuaoarsWorkshop)) on Windows 10
* Several factors have impelled me to go through this series of lessons and **complete them using Visual Studio on Windows**
	* I have dabbled with pythonOCC for years, shying away from OpenCascade using C++
	* I have recently spun up on learning C++
	* Historically, I have found precious few code examples of OpenCascade or Python OCC
		* These lessons have just recently become available (about a year ago)
	* I have been stuck trying to figure out how to implement OCAF / XCAF in Kodacad
	* The author of this series, Sergey Slyadnev, is the nearest thing to a subject matter expert as I have ever found
		* So if I hope to learn from him, I need to put in the time to compete all his lessons (on Windows)
			* Many of the lessons will **only** run on Windows.
			* All these tutorials are done using Visual Studio on Windows
		* The author is also associated with [Analysis Situs](http://www.analysissitus.org/) which has a [forum](http://analysissitus.org/forum/index.php) where members can get answers to OpenCascade (C++) related questions. 
		* I definitely have questions:
			* Using Undo / Redo
			* Using app.SaveAs / app.Load()
			* How to load step files into an existing TDocStd document
			* How to manipulate the hierarcdhical assembly structure
		* So I need to be able to ask questions in their language (C++ on Windows):
			1. Take a stab at how to do whatever (in C++ on Windows)
			2. I then need to be able to implement their suggestions (in C++ on Windows)
		* Only then will it make sense to translate the solution into Python syntax.
			* I have already seen that there is no patience for broadening the scope of interest to include PythonOCC.
			* I posted a comment on Lesson 15 with a link to my pythonOCC equivalent code to the C++ code and it was quickly and silently removed.

Important!
As I went through the Quaoar's Workshop OpenCascade tutorials, I learned that (with the exception of Lesson 2) they all use AIS Viewer to display solid shapes. The C++ code for using the AIS Viewer is written to ONLY compile on Windows.
